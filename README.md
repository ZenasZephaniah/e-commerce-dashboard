The **Server-Rendered E-Commerce Product Management Dashboard** is a secure, full-stack administrative portal built with **Next.js 15**. It is designed to simplify inventory management for store administrators. This application leverages **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** to ensure fast page loads, SEO optimization, and reliable data fetching.

The dashboard is protected to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. Please use the following dummy credentials to access the live demo: **Username:** `admin` and **Password:** `password123`

## Key Features

* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Product data is fetched on the server before rendering, ensuring instant initial page loads and improved performance compared to client-side fetching.
* **Secure Authentication & Onboarding** - **Middleware Protection:** Custom Middleware verifies session tokens on every request and **Secure Admin Onboarding:** A protected route allows existing administrators to onboard new admins securely (restricted to authenticated users only).
* **Complete CRUD Operations** -
  * **Create:** Multi-step form with **Zod validation** and **Cloudinary** image upload,
  * **Read:** Dynamic data table with real-time updates,
  * **Update/Delete:** Secure actions to manage inventory.
* **Data Visualization** - Interactive **Bar** and **Pie** charts (via Recharts) visualize stock levels and inventory distribution.
* **Sales Module** - Dedicated tracking for product sales performance.

## Application Workflow
1. **Request:** Admin accesses the secure URL.
2. **Auth:** Middleware intercepts the request to verify the session token.
3. **Fetch:** Server connects to MongoDB to fetch the latest product data (SSR).
4. **Render:** Page is sent fully populated to the browser.
5. **Interact:** Admin updates products; server revalidates data instantly.
